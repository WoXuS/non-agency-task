A web page built with semantic HTML and optimized CSS following the BEM convention, recreated from a Figma design mockup. This project focuses on minimizing boilerplate, sharing styles across sections for efficiency, and maintaining semantic structure for SEO enhancement. Special attention has been given to ensuring all images, including placeholders, have descriptive alternative texts.
